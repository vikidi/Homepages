This is my personal home page's code base which is at villesaarinen.me.

## Server
These websites are currently running on a single Raspberry Pi 3B+ board. Later when I mention server it means this board.

Production instances of the application are managed with PM2 and can be reviewed from pm2.io. 

## Security
The server uses following programs to ensure better security. Reports generated by Logwatch and Fail2Ban are send to my email via Sendmail and SendinBlue SMTP server.   
- UFW
- Logwatch
- Fail2Ban
- ClamAV

### Hacking Me
Please do not try to hack my site or my server!

If you still try to hack me and even succeed in it, please make an issue to this repo covering the vulnerabilities :slightly_smiling_face:

## Overall System
Not going into too much detail here for security reasons. If you want to know more feel free to contact me directly.

Domain name (villesaarinen.me) is from GoDaddy.

Moved nameservers to CloudFlare, which handles the routing to my DDNS. CloudFlare provides mainly CDN and extra security to the application.

DDNS is from no-ip, which connects to my routers public ip. The server has noip2-program running, which checks every 30 minutes if the public ip has changed and changes it to no-ip DDNS server.

My router forwards requests to the server's private ip address. This is setup to be static in the local network.

On the server is Nginx reverse-proxy server which recives the requests and forwards them to the port where the application is running.

## About The Code
This section mainly discusses about the code itself.

### Get Started

### Frontend
To be continued...

### Backend
To be continued...

## CI/CD
This section is about the continuous integration and deployment that the project has. This consists of Github action and 3rd party applications reviewing the code base.

### Github actions
To be continued...

### 3rd Party Applications
Mainly using these products to learn about them:  
- CodeClimate  
- Cypress  
- Imgbot  
- Renovate  
- Whitesource Bolt  
- Snyk  
- CodeCov

### Unit Testing
Unit testing is done in both frontend and backend cases with Jest.  
To be continued...

### Integration Testing
Integration testing is also done using Jest and it mainly consists of API testing for backend.  
To be continued...

### End-2-End Testing
E2E-testing is done by using cypress. Also npm package "start-server-and-test" is used in CI pipeline to run these tests easily.  
To be continued...

### Coverage
Testing coverage is generated by Jest combined from unit and integration testing and it is then uploaded to Codecov for further investigation.
