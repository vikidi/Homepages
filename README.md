This is my personal home page's code base.

## Server
These websites are currently running on a single Raspberry Pi 3B+ board. Later when I mention server it means this board.

Production instances of the application are managed with PM2. 

## Security
The server uses following programs to ensure better security. Reports generated by Logwatch and Fail2Ban are send to my email via Sendmail and SendinBlue - SMTP server.   
- UFW
- Logwatch
- Fail2Ban
- ClamAV

### Hacking Me
Please do not try to hack my site or my server!

If you still try to hack me and even succeed in it, please make an issue to this repo covering the vulnerabilities :slightly_smiling_face:

## Overall System
Not going into too much detail here for security reasons. If you want to know more feel free to contact me directly.

Domain name (villesaarinen.me) is from GoDaddy.

Moved nameservers to CloudFlare, which handles the routing to my DDNS. CloudFlare provides mainly CDN and extra security to the application.

DDNS is from no-ip, which connects to my routers public ip. The server has noip2-program running, which check every 30 minutes if the public ip has changed and changes it to no-ip DDNS server.

My router forwards requests to the server's private ip address. This is setup to be static in the local network.

On the server is Nginx reverse-proxy server which recives the requests and forwards them to the port where the application is running.
